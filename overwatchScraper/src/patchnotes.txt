PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
-New Hero: Orisa (Tank)
-Built from the scraps of the city’s decommissioned OR15 defense bots, Orisa is still learning how to optimally perform her function. What she lacks in experience, she makes up for in her steadfast dedication to keeping her city—and her creator, Efi—safe from harm.
-Orisa is the sixth tank to join the Overwatch lineup, and much like her programming, her gameplay is engineered around protection. Her main weapon is a rapid-fire Fusion Driver, an automatic gun with good range and accuracy even at a distance—though it comes at a cost. Orisa’s movement slows down while she fires and players will need to plan for a lengthy reload time. Her alternate fire, Halt!, launches a graviton charge across the map, slowing nearby enemies as it passes, then pulling them toward it when it detonates.
-Her Fortify ability boosts her personal defense, reducing damage taken and making her unstoppable for a short time. She can throw a device that creates a curved, stationary Protective Barrier, perfect for intercepting projectiles and shielding teammates from the front, sides, and above. Lastly, as her ultimate ability, Orisa deploys a high-powered Supercharger that beams a buff to allies within its range, increasing the damage they can inflict on the opposing team.

GENERAL UPDATES
-Competitive Play
--On Route 66, the attacking team is now given 60 additional seconds after pushing the payload to the first checkpoint.
-Developer Comments: This change will bring Route 66 in line with the other Escort maps.
-Custom Game and Game Browser
--When setting up a Custom Game, players can now disable or modify abilities activated with the secondary fire button
HERO UPDATES
-Ana
--Biotic Rifle
---Damage decreased from 80 to 60
-Developer Comments: Ana’s kit has several strong components, which makes her difficult to replace. Reducing her damage output will make her less threatening on attack and reduce her dueling capabilities.
-Bastion
--Ironclad
---[XB1, PS4] Bastion now takes 20% less damage while in Configuration: Sentry or Tank (formerly 35%)
-Developer Comments: After the last update, Bastion became a little too difficult to deal with, so we’re reducing his new passive to give enemies more opportunities to counter.
-Junkrat
--Total Mayhem
---Junkrat’s explosions no longer hurt himself
-Developer Comments: Previously, Junkrat’s projectile speed made him difficult to use at long ranges, but the damage he took from his own explosions made him difficult to use at close ranges. This change makes him more effective at close ranges, allowing Junkrat players to explore new strategies.
-Mercy
--Caduceus Staff
---The amount of increased damage that’s done when boosting another player is now tracked under the match statistics and on the Career Profile page
-Sombra
--Hack
---Sombra’s teammates can now see hacked healthpacks through walls
--Stealth
---Sound effects and VO distance has been reduced to 15 meters when Sombra enters or exits Stealth
--Translocator
---Cooldown reduced from 6 seconds to 4 seconds
-Developer Comments: Sombra can be devastating in the right hands, but infiltrating and harassing enemies could often feel difficult. These changes should increase her effectiveness and teamplay.
-Winston
--Barrier Projector
---Ability cooldown now starts when the barrier is placed, instead of when it ends
-Developer Comments: This change should help Winston do what he does best: distract the enemy team and block damage.
-Zarya
--Particle Barrier
---No longer protects Zarya from knockback
--Projected Barrier
---No longer protects allies from knockback
-Developer Comments: This is actually reverting a change that we made a few patches ago, which made players immune to knockbacks if they were hit by an effect from inside her barrier. This had some negative side effects, such as making targets immune to knockbacks from effects that pierce barriers, like Reinhardt’s charge and Winston’s Primal Rage punches. Now, these will cause knockback again. This does not affect knockbacks from effects that originate from outside her barriers, such as Pharah’s Concussive Blast. Those will still be blocked by the barriers, not causing any knockback.
-Zenyatta
--Orb of Destruction
---Alternate fire cooldown has been reduced from 1 seconds to 0.6 seconds
---Weapon spread has been removed
-Developer Comments: Zenyatta’s alternate fire often felt too difficult to use due to its long recovery time. This reduction should make it a more viable option. Also, his weapon has always had a very small amount of spread. This wasn’t enough to change the way he was played, but it would occasionally cause shots to miss that would normally hit their target. Removing this small variance should help him feel more consistent.
BUG FIXES
-General
--When Teleporters, Shield Generators, and other player-owned objects are destroyed, the kill feed now properly displays the owner’s name
-A.I.
--Fixed a bug preventing Bastion and Torbjörn bots from taking a defensive position when turret abilities were disabled in Custom Games
-Competitive Play
--Fixed a visual bug that prevented your current medals from being displayed in the setup phase between rounds
-Custom Game and Game Browser
--Fixed a bug causing players to respawn in the enemy spawn room after being pinned against a car by an enemy Reinhardt on Oasis
--A scoring requirement clarification has been added to the Capture the Flag settings, stating that each team’s flag will need to be secured before they can score
--Fixed a bug that could cause certain settings to be displayed on the Custom Game’s information screen even when they weren’t being used
--Fixed an issue preventing values from the “Ultimate Generation” setting from being correctly displayed
--Heroes and maps are now sorted alphabetically under the “Find Game” filters in the Game Browser
--Fixed a bug preventing Bastion’s Self-Repair ability from being disabled in the Custom Game settings
-Heroes
--Fixed an issue preventing Bastion’s walking animation from being triggered while Self-Repair was in use
--McCree no longer receives credit toward his on-fire meter when his Flashbang is used against Mei’s Ice Wall
--Fixed a bug that kept a successful Roadhog hook from counting towards the “Match Players Hooked” statistic when the enemy player was killed on impact
--Fixed an issue causing Zenyatta’s feet to clip through his robe while his Sanzang skin was equipped
--Fixed a bug causing Reaper's shotguns and D.Va's mech to appear unusually large on the main menu
-Maps

BUG FIXES
-General
--Fixed a bug that prevented the Damage Amplified stat from appearing in the scoreboard at the end of a game
-Heroes
--Fixed a bug to prevent Orisa to deploy her Supercharger inside of the payload
--Fixed a bug that prevented Sombra’s “BOOP” voice line from playing
--Orisa’s movement now slows slightly while firing in midair
-Developer Comments: Much like D.Va’s Fusion Cannons, Orisa’s Fusion Driver is intended to slow her movement while she is firing. However, unlike D.Va, there was an issue that prevented this slow from working while firing from the air.

-Please note that these changes will be rolled into a larger patch for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One at a later date.
HERO UPDATES
-General
--The total damage reduction that a hero can receive while buffed (e.g. from Ana's Nano Boost and Orisa's Fortify) has been capped at 50% (formerly 70%)
-Bastion
--Ironclad
---Bastion now takes 20% less damage while in Configuration: Sentry or Tank (formerly 35%)
-Developer Comments: After introducing the new Ironclad passive ability in the last patch, Bastion felt a little too difficult to deal with. This reduction maintains his survivability while he’s transformed, but he shouldn’t feel so overbearing to enemies.
-Zarya
--Particle Barrier
---No longer protects Zarya from knockback
--Projected Barrier
---No longer protects allies from knockback
-Developer Comments: This change is actually reverting an attempted bug fix from a previous patch. Now, Zarya’s barriers no longer protect players who are hit by a knockback effect that pierces the shield. This change does not affect knockback abilities that occur outside the barriers. For example, if Zarya has a barrier on herself and is hit by one of Pharah’s concussive blasts, she won’t be affected, because the barrier blocked the effect. However, if Winston uses his ultimate and starts to swing at Zarya, it will now knock her back even if a protective barrier is active, since melee attacks pierce barriers.
BUG FIXES
-General
--Fixed an issue preventing heroes in 1v1 Mystery Duel from being shuffled correctly
-Competitive Play
--Fixed an issue preventing players from loading the Season 1 and 2 leaderboards
-Heroes
--Fixed an issue preventing D.Va’s Defense Matrix from properly blocking enemy fire that has passed through another enemy hero
--Fixed an issue preventing Winston’s hitbox from lining up with his pose while crouched

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
-New Feature: Game Browser
-Starting today, every player can create their own, unique Overwatch experience and share it with their friends, teammates, or the entire world. Introducing the Game Browser.
-An extension of Overwatch's Custom Game mode, the Game Browser allows you to adjust the settings on various maps, modes, and heroes to create your own tailor-made match. For example, if you want to increase the speed of Pharah’s rockets or remove the cooldown from McCree's Combat Roll, the power is yours. Once you're happy with your settings, and you're ready to launch your game, you'll need to set up permissions. You can limit the people who can join your game by toggling the "Friends Only" or "Invite Only" options, but if you want to put your strange creation to a real test, set your server to "Public" and click the launch button.
-If you'd like to learn more about the Game Browser, click here.
-New Mode: Capture the Flag
-Capture the Rooster has been, without a doubt, Overwatch’s most popular brawl. We don’t want the excitement to end, so we’re bringing Capture the Flag to the Arcade as an ongoing game mode. Starting today, we’re adding Capture the Flag versions of Nepal, Lijiang Tower, Ilios, and Oasis, which gives you 12 maps to try when creating a Custom Game.
HERO UPDATES
-Ana
--New Hero Option: Nano Boost Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust Nano Boost’s targeting sensitivity
-Bastion
--Configuration: Sentry
---Reconfiguration time decreased from 1.5 seconds to 1.0 second
---Bullet spread increased by 50%
---Bullet spread is always at maximum (it no longer increases as the weapon is fired)
---Magazine size increased from 200 to 300
---No longer deals critical damage
--Configuration: Recon
---Bullet spread decreased by 25%
---Magazine size increased from 20 to 25
--Self-Repair
---Can now be used while moving
---Now bound to secondary fire (formerly Ability 2)
---No longer interrupted by taking damage
---A new resource meter has been added that depletes while Self-Repair is active and recharges when not in use
--Configuration: Tank
---No longer grants bonus armor
--New Passive Ability: Ironclad
---Bastion takes 35% less damage while in Configuration: Sentry or Tank
-Developer Comments: The goal of these changes is to move some of Bastion's power from Configuration: Sentry to Recon, while keeping its sentry mode a strong option, especially versus tanks and barriers. Overall, Bastion should feel stronger and more flexible with these changes.
-D.Va
--Defense Matrix
---Enemy shots no longer need to travel a minimum distance before they can be blocked
-Developer Comments: Previously, there was a minimum distance a projectile had to travel before it could be destroyed by Defense Matrix. This made it nearly worthless in situations where an enemy was right next to your teammate, such as when Roadhog hooks your ally. This change removes that restriction so Defense Matrix should now reliably destroy projectiles regardless of how far they have traveled.
-Mei
--Cryo-Freeze
---Can now be targeted by allies while in Cryo-Freeze
-Mercy
--Resurrect
---While performing a resurrection, Mercy now becomes temporarily invulnerable along with the allies being revived
--Caduceus Staff
---Zenyatta can no longer be targeted while Transcendence is active
--New Hero Option: Guardian Angel Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust Guardian Angel’s targeting sensitivity
--New Hero Option: Beam Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust targeting sensitivity on Mercy’s Caduceus Staff beams
-Developer Comments: Mercy’s Resurrect has always been very powerful, but it often forces her to sacrifice herself to use it well. There have been changes in the past that attempted to help her in this area, but haven’t done enough to solve it. This change means that once she uses the ability, she will always survive long enough to be with her team again.
-Roadhog
--Scrap Gun
---Spread decreased by 20%
--Chain Hook
---Targets are now pulled to a location 3.5 meters away, up from 2 meters
---Cooldown increased from 6 to 8
-Developer Comments: Overall, the Roadhog changes reduce the power of his hook a bit, but his gun is now more effective when not using the hook.
-Sombra
--New Hero Option: Hack Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust the targeting sensitivity on Sombra’s Hack ability
-Torbjörn
--Rivet Gun
---Ammo is now loaded earlier in the reload animation
-Widowmaker
--New Hero Option: Grappling Hook Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust Grappling Hook’s targeting sensitivity
-Zarya
--New Hero Option: Projected Barrier Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust Projected Barrier’s targeting sensitivity
-Zenyatta
--New Hero Option: Harmony Orb Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust Harmony Orb’s targeting sensitivity
--New Hero Option: Discord Orb Sensitivity
---Allows players to adjust Discord Orb’s targeting sensitivity
COMPETITIVE PLAY
-General
--Players with a skill rating above 3000 will need to complete at least seven games per week to avoid skill rating decay
--Skill ratings below 500 will no longer be displayed.
-Developer Comments: We’ve noticed that some players have been deliberately throwing their matches in an effort to reach the lowest attainable skill rating. We obviously don’t want to incentivize this behavior, because Competitive Play works best when everybody is trying. The changes to the skill rating decay system will improve the accuracy of the player’s skill rating, make maintaining multiple high-level accounts more difficult, and make upper-tier placement more meaningful.
MAP BALANCE CHANGES
-General
--Respawn Delay
---When attackers outnumber defenders while taking a control point on Assault, Escort and Assault/Escort maps, the defenders’ respawn time will slowly increase until it hits a maximum value or the defense manages to gain the upper hand. 
-Developer Comments: Until now, stalling an attack by repeatedly throwing yourself at the point has been a common defensive strategy on Assault, Escort and Assault/Escort maps—even when the attackers have a decisive advantage. Typically, this tactic doesn’t change the outcome of battle; it simply delays the attackers’ progress.
-Eichenwalde
--A second gate no longer closes after the payload passes through the castle doors. Instead, rubble from the damaged doorway partially blocks the entrance.
-Developer Comments: Once the offensive team gets through the castle entrance, the map becomes very heavily stacked in the defense’s favor. This change will give the offense more entrance options, which should improve the map’s overall balance. 
BUG FIXES
-General
--Fixed an audio bug that prevented the point capture sound from increasing in pitch as the capture progressed
--Fixed an issue preventing key bindings on the communication wheel from displaying properly
--Fixed a bug causing some key bindings to revert to default after the first round of a Control map
--Fixed a bug that allowed commendation cards to be recalculated and transferred to a new player after the previous recipient left at the end of a round
--Fixed a bug that caused the “experience gained” audio effects to continue playing, even after the players left the game lobby
--Environmental damage to barriers no longer counts toward the "Damage Blocked" statistic
-A.I.
--Fixed a bug that caused Roadhog bot to spin around after hooking a target
-Competitive Play
--Fixed a bug preventing “60 seconds remaining” and “30 seconds remaining” voice lines from playing during the second round of a match
-Heroes
--Fixed a bug preventing Lucio’s “Sound Barriers Provided” statistic from being properly calculated
--Fixed a bug preventing Reinhardt’s Charge from properly pinning targets
--Fixed a bug preventing Reinhardt’s shield from displaying cracks at low health with the Wujing skin equipped
--Fixed a bug that allowed Roadhog to turn freely while pulling a hooked target
--Fixed an issue that allowed Sombra’s Translocator to become stuck in the air
--Fixed a bug preventing Tracer’s ”Clock’s Tickin’’ spray from matching the thumbnail in the Hero Gallery

--Adjusted the collision in the attacker spawn room on Eichenwalde to prevent players from getting stuck in the pipes
--Torbjörn can now construct turrets on the stairs in Oasis
--Fixed an issue that caused Highlight Intros to clip into the roof of a building on Lijang Tower

-Kill Feed

--Headshot eliminations are now indicated with a red icon
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
-Ana
--Biotic Grenade
---Effect duration has been reduced from 5 seconds to 4 seconds
---Healing boost on allies has been decreased by 50%
-Developer Comments: The healing boost from Ana’s Biotic Grenade was providing too much healing, especially when used on targets with large health pools.
-D.Va
--Health increased from 200 to 400
--Armor decreased from 400 to 200
--Fusion Cannons
---Bullet damage decreased from 3 to 2
---Number of bullets per shot has been increased from 8 to 11
-Developer Comments:  D.Va’s armor often made her feel like she had no weaknesses, even against heroes that are typically effective against bigger targets (like Reaper). The changes to her primary fire will result in a small overall decrease in damage, but her Fusion Cannons should feel more consistent now.
-Lucio
--New Hero Option: Allow Backwards Wall Ride
---When enabled, allows Lucio to start wall riding while moving backwards.
-Roadhog
--Chain Hook
---Targets are now pulled directly in front of Roadhog (rather than straight to him), except in cases where Roadhog drastically rotates
---Hooked targets are now released if they leave Roadhog’s line of sight before being pulled
---Line of sight checks (which determines if targets are hit by the hook) are now done from Roadhog’s position, rather than the hook’s position
-Developer Comments: The hook should now feel more consistent for Roadhog players, but it should also feel more reasonable to his enemies, as they cannot be hooked or pulled around corners anymore.
-Sombra
--Hack
---Cooldown has been reduced from 12 seconds to 8 seconds
---Time it takes to hack a target has been decreased from 1 second to 0.8 seconds
-Developer Comments: Sombra often had difficulty hacking enemies, even when she surprised the target. This change should help her execute hacks more easily.
BUG FIXES
-General
--Fixed a bug allowing spectators to utilize the “Stay as Team” button during the end of a game

--Fixed a bug preventing Alt+Tab from properly minimizing the game client while in fullscreen mode

--Fixed a bug that prevented the Roadhog bot from being able to hook players through Reinhardt’s shield

--Fixed a bug that made the Torbjörn bot unresponsive after placing a turret

GENERAL UPDATES
-General
--Added a new "Boop" unlockable voice line for Sombra
--Players can now select the 1v1 Mystery Duel and 3v3 Elimination game modes from the Custom Game menu
--Added a "Stay as Team" feature, which allows players to remain grouped with their teammates after the match has ended
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
-Symmetra
--Photon Barrier (New Ability)
---Replaces her existing Photon Shield ability
---Generates a large energy barrier in front of Symmetra that blocks enemy fire as it travels forward
--Shield Generator (New Ultimate Ability Option)
---Symmetra's Ultimate ability now offers a choice between Teleporter and a new option: Shield Generator
---Shield Generator places a device that grants additional shields to allies within its effective radius (regardless of barriers, walls, or obstacles between them and the Shield Generator)
--Photon Projector (Primary Fire)
---Range has been increased from 5 meters to 7 meters
--Sentry Turret
---Turrets that can be carried have been increased from 3 turrets to 6 turrets
---Cooldown has been reduced from 12 seconds to 10 seconds
--Photon Shield
---Replaced with the new Photon Barrier ability
--Teleporter
---Health has been decreased from 200 to 50
---Shields have been increased from 0 to 350
-Developer Comments: We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn't feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modes.
-To address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team.
-For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn"t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. 
-The turret changes allow her to rebuild her turret nests faster. Even if all her turrets are wiped out, it's now easier for players to build them all back up before the next push. 
-We're also increasing the range on her Photon Projector to make it easier for her to build up and keep a powerful charge on her target.
-Zarya
--Particle Barrier/Projected Barrier
---Attacks like Reinhardt's Fire Strike or Hanzo's Dragonstrike that deal damage to both the barrier and the hero within the barrier, no longer deal damage to the barrier twice
-Developer Comments: This is a bug fix, but we think it's significant enough to warrant a separate note. We've had a long-standing bug that caused "piercing" damage to hit Zarya's barrier twice. Sometimes this benefited Zarya (for example, jumping in front of Reinhardt's Fire Strike was a good way to generate a large amount of energy quickly), and sometimes it really hurt her (Genji's Dragonblade, for example, would cut through her shield in one swing, instead of two). This change isn't intended to buff or a nerf to Zarya. We're simply trying get her abilities working as they should, and we'll keep an eye on how it affects her balance.
BUG FIXES
-General
--[PS4 Pro] Fixed a bug that could obscure or hide UI elements on a 4K display

PATCH FEATURES
-New Hero: Sombra (Offense)
-One of the world's most notorious hackers is stepping out of the shadows: Sombra, a mysterious infiltrator who uses information to control those in power.
-Sombra is a master manipulator who can hack her enemies, temporarily blocking their abilities. In addition, she can hack health packs and Torbjorn's turret, making them useless to her opponents. She uses her fully automatic Machine Pistol to take out her enemies, getting into position using her Thermoptic Camo, which allows her to become invisible and move more quickly for short periods of time. This gives her the ability to slip past enemy defenses undetected, but she's instantly revealed if she takes damage or attacks an enemy. She also has a Translocator, which can be tossed like a grenade. When it’s activated, Sombra is teleported to its location (even while it’s in flight).
-Sombra's ultimate ability, EMP, discharges electromagnetic energy in a wide radius, hacking anyone caught within range and destroying enemy barriers and shields. To learn more about Sombra, click here.
-New Feature: The Arcade!
-Discover brand new ways to play Overwatch in the Arcade. Choose from a variety of regularly rotating game modes, maps, and rulesets that don't quite fit into Quick Play or Competitive Play. Whether it's 1-on-1 duels, 3-vs-3 skirmishes, our alternating selection of brawls, or special rulesets like “no hero switching,” you should have no problem finding a game that fits your mood. Experience is earned just like any other mode, but you can also earn Arcade-specific rewards, like Loot Boxes!
-New Arena Map: Ecopoint: Antarctica
-Bundle up for a journey to Ecopoint: Antarctica, the former Overwatch installation where climatologist Mei-Ling Zhou was once stationed. While researching severe weather anomalies in the region, the station was hit by an intense polar storm. Running out of options and low on supplies, the team decided to cryogenically freeze themselves until the storm passed. They believed that it would only be for a few months, but Mei awoke nearly a decade later.
-Ecopoint: Antarctica is a compact new Arena map that features multiple new game modes, including a 3-vs-3 battle and 1-on-1 duel. Check it out in the Arcade.
-Season 3 of Competitive Play
-Competitive Play's second season will end on November 23 at 4PM PDT (November 24 at 0:00 UTC), and the third season will begin on November 30 at 4PM PDT (December 1 at 0:00 UTC). During the week-long off season, you'll still be able to queue for matches using the Competitive Play ruleset, but your skill rating will not be affected and no Competitive Points will be awarded.
-We've also made a few adjustments to the skill rating system for season 3. Players will be distributed more broadly across the skill tiers, which means that your season 3 rating will probably be lower than the previous season.
-Developer Comments: When season 2 started, we had more players in the Gold and Platinum skill tiers than we originally intended. This meant that skill levels varied widely for players within those tiers, and some players were achieving inappropriately high rankings during their placement matches. These players typically began the season by having their skill rating adjusted downwards after their first few matches. For season 3, skill ratings will be slightly lower after your placement matches, allowing them to increase as the season begins. After you play enough matches, your skill rating changes will return to normal.
GENERAL UPDATES
-General
--Made a number of data format improvements, which should decrease load times and reduce the game’s storage space requirements
--Made several adjustments to the amount of experience needed to level:
---The amount of experience needed to reach levels 2 through 13 remains unchanged
---The amount of experience needed to reach levels 14 through 100 has been slightly reduced
---The amount of experience needed to reach levels after 100 is now constant (20,000 XP) and will no longer reset after each promotion
-Developer Comments: With the way our experience curve works right now, players move fairly quickly through the first 23 levels of each tier (1-23, 101-123, 201-223, etc.). This is because when a player is promoted after 100 levels, the experience curve resets. While this reset has worked pretty well so far, it’s also encouraged some people to stop playing the game after they’re promoted—hoping to save those first 23 levels for a seasonal event. To help address this, the experience needed for all post-promotion levels (any level after 100) is now consistently 20,000 and will no longer reset. The total experience required to gain 100 levels after a promotion is roughly unchanged, but the total experience required to earn the first 100 levels (before the first promotion) has been slightly reduced.
--Quick Play matches are now restricted to one of each hero per team
-Developer Comments: We’ve been monitoring your feedback to the 1-hero limit in Competitive Play. Overall, we believe the game is in a better place in terms of balance and stability with the hero limit in place. For this reason, we have decided to add the 1-hero limit to Quick Play. We understand that there are a lot of players who enjoy the ability to play multiples of the same hero, so we have introduced a new mode to the Arcade called “No Limits.” This mode uses Quick Play’s original ruleset, which allows for hero stacking.
-Spectating
--The number of observer slots in Custom Games has been increased from 6 to 12
HERO BALANCE CHANGES
-General
--Dealing damage to things other than players (like Torbjorn's turret or Symmetra's teleporter) no longer charges ultimate abilities
--Ultimate costs have been increased by 25% for all heroes
-Developer Comments: Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful.
-Ana
--Nano Boost
---No longer increases move speed
-Developer Comments: The increased speed from Ana’s Nano Boost made the ability feel unstoppable and forced Ana players to select targets that could really take advantage of the speed boost. Removing the speed boost means that Ana has a reason to apply Nano Boost to a larger variety of heroes, and enemies can fend off the attack more easily
-D.Va
--Call Mech
---Ultimate cost has been decreased by 20%
--Mech health increased to 200 (formerly 100). Armor remains at 400
--Movement speed while firing has been increased by 25%
-Developer Comments: We reduced the cost of the Call Mech ultimate ability to compensate for the increased ultimate cost across all heroes (detailed above). D.Va players shouldn’t experience a noticeable change. The rest of these changes help D.Va’s withstand attacks, which will allow her to keep pressuring enemies.
-Lúcio
--Amp It Up
---Healing per second has been decreased by 10%
-Developer Comments: Lucio’s overall healing output has always been on par with (or even higher) than Overwatch’s other healers, and his other benefits made him an almost mandatory pick.
-Mei
--Blizzard
---Ultimate cost has been increased by 15%
-Developer Comments: Mei’s ultimate was recently given a much larger radius. Now it’s coming up too frequently, considering the impact it can have.
-Mercy
--Passive health regeneration now activates when Mercy avoids taking damage for 1 second (formerly 3 seconds)
-Developer Comments:  This change allows Mercy to survive more easily by evading enemy fire. 
-Pharah
--Rocket Launcher
---Minimum explosion damage has been increased by 13%
---Minimum explosion knockback has been decreased to 0%
--Jump Jets
---Lift increased by 35%
-Developer Comments: These changes will make the explosions from Pharah's Rocket Launcher more deadly, so hitting multiple targets should feel better. Her Jump Jets are also getting a boost to increase maneuverability while hovering.
-Soldier: 76
--Pulse Rifle
---Bullet damage increased from 17 to 20
---Maximum bullet spread increased from 2.2 to 2.4
-Developer Comments: Soldier: 76's damage felt a little low when compared to similar heroes. This increase affects both his normal fire and his ultimate.
-Torbjörn
--Scrap is now automatically generated over time
--The amount of scrap collected from a fallen enemy has been decreased by 40%
--Forge Hammer
---Swing speed increased by 25%
---Damage decreased by 27%
-Developer Comments: Armor Packs have always been a powerful tool in Torbjörn's arsenal, but it was often difficult to gather enough scrap to give your team a legitimate boost when they needed it. Conversely, if a team held on long enough, the scrap collected from fallen enemies was often able to generate so many armor packs that enemy teams had a difficult time turning the tide. Automatically generating scrap over time helps smooth out these differences and makes Torbjörn more viable. His hammer swing speed was increased to help him construct level 2 turrets more quickly.
-Widowmaker
--Venom Mine
---Explosion no longer damages the player who placed the mine
--Widow's Kiss
---Charge rate increased by 20%
-Developer Comments: These changes allow Widowmaker to be more flexible and reactive.
-Zarya
--Particle Barrier
---Power gained from barriers decreased by 20%
--ProjectedBarrier
---Power gained from barriers decreased by 20%
-Developer Comments: Considering her potential damage output, Zarya was starting to feel like a mandatory pick in most situations. Rather than reduce her damage output, this change makes achieving her maximum power and damage output slightly more difficult.

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
-New Seasonal Event: Overwatch Halloween Terror
-When the shadows grow long and the nights grow cold . . . when witches cackle in the night, and ghosts roam the streets . . . it can mean only one thing: Halloween has arrived in Overwatch! Starting today, Overwatch's regular Loot Boxes have been replaced with limited-edition Halloween Loot Boxes. Each contains at least one of more than 100 Halloween-themed sprays, icons, skins, victory poses, emotes, and highlight intros. And the bravest heroes will test their mettle against a mad scientist's metal minions in Overwatch's first co-op PvE brawl: Junkenstein’s Revenge.
-Welcome to Overwatch Halloween Terror!
-To learn more about the event, click here.
-New Feature: Leaderboards
-In-game leaderboards will now show off the top 500 competitive players from each region, and a separate leaderboard will allow players to see how their competitive performance stacks up against their Battle.net friends. Plus, we’re adding leaderboards for the Overwatch Halloween Terror event that’s happening right now!
-Note: After downloading the latest patch, players will need to complete at least one Competitive Play match before they’ll appear on the Battle.net friend leaderboards.

-Spectating
--Camera movement in Spectator Mode has been improved
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
-Ana
--Nano Boost
---Ultimate cost has been increased by 20%
--Biotic Grenade
---Radius has been increased from 3 to 4 meters
-Developer Comments: So far, we haven't seen any indication that Ana is too strong overall, but her ultimate charges a little too fast, especially considering the impact it can have on a match. Also, her Biotic Grenades are getting a small boost to help her hit multiple targets.
-Widowmaker
--Widow's Kiss
---Scoping-in animation time has been reduced from 0.5 to 0.33 seconds
-Developer Comments: This change will help Widowmaker acquire new targets more quickly and speed up her reaction time in fast-paced situations.
-Junkrat
--RIP-Tire
---Ability now activates more quickly
-Developer Comments: Junkrat can be an extremely effective hero in the right hands, but RIP-Tire often felt underpowered when compared to his counterparts.

This mode will allow for more precise aiming, while still allowing players to turn around quickly
---Exponential Ramp mode (Old default): As the thumbstick moves toward the outside of its range, the sensitivity is ramped up exponentially. The acceleration remains relatively high throughout
-Social Features
--Certain commendations will now appear less frequently during end-of-round voting, and others will appear more frequently (e.g. Torbjörn's Armor Packs Created will appear less frequently while Offensive Assists will appear more frequently)

PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
-Competitive Play Season 2
-We've made some big changes to Competitive Play in Season 2. The most noticeable change is the introduction of skill tiers, which we hope will better communicate players' relative skill levels. Competitive Play will put a greater emphasis on skill tiers over specific ratings, and as such, a player's tier will be more prominently displayed throughout the game. We've also switched the skill rating system to a 1-5000 scale to give players more detailed information about how each match affects their specific rating.
-Sudden Death is also going away in Season 2. Instead, matches that are tied when the clock runs out end in a draw—though, it should be a rare occurrence. Because of this, we've made some changes to our game modes in Competitive Play to help reduce the chance that a draw can happen.
-We've also made a few minor adjustments to leaver penalties, the Top 500 system, and the competitive point system. Read on below to learn more!
-New Assault/Escort Map: Eichenwalde
-The forest has slowly begun overtaking the abandoned village of Eichenwalde, but the scars will never completely fade. During the Omnic Crisis, Eichenwalde was the site of a key battle. General Balderich von Adler took a handful of crusaders to the village in an effort to outflank the omnic army. Balderich's soldiers were able to break down the enemy forces, giving the German military an opportunity to push back, but the Crusaders didn't make it out of the battle. General Balderich finally collapsed in the castle's great hall.

--Sit and laugh emotes are now unlockable for all heroes
--New Legendary skins have been added for Reinhardt

----Platinum - 2500-2999
----Diamond - 3000-3499
----Master - 3500-3999
----Grandmaster - 4000-5000
---In Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers, a player will not drop out of their tier even if their skill rating falls below the cutoff
---In Master and Grandmaster tiers, a player whose skill rating falls below the tier's minimum will be moved to a lower tier
---Players that have reached the Master and Grandmaster tiers must be within 500 Skill Rating of their groupmates
---Players that are Diamond-tier and below must be within 1000 Skill Rating of their groupmates
--Skill Rating Decay
---Players in Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster tiers that haven't participated in a competitive match for 7 days will lose skill rating

---Competing in a single match will halt skill rating decay
---Players that haven't participated in a competitive match for 7 days will immediately drop out of the top 500
--Map Changes

-
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
-General
--Ultimates that consume the ultimate meter when activated will now drain the meter more quickly (.25 second instead of 1 second)
--Reverted a recent change that reduced the size of heroes' projectiles
--Most hero abilities will no longer interrupt quick melee attacks
--Ultimate abilities will now interrupt quick melee attacks
-Developer Comments: Altering the size of projectiles in flight had too many unintended side effects to keep in the game, at least in its current form. We will continue watching this and make additional changes if necessary. We’re also making quick melee more consistent when interacting with enemy abilities.
-D.Va
--Defense Matrix
---After being activated, Defense Matrix will begin regenerating following a 1-second delay (formerly .5 seconds)
-Developer Comments: Defense Matrix was too efficient when tapped repeatedly, instead of being held. Now, the recovery delay matches the ability cooldown.
-Hanzo
--Hanzo will now experience a 30% decrease in speed while aiming (formerly 40%)
--Maximum projectile speed has been increased by 30%
--Arrow size has been reduced by 33%
-Developer Comments: Hanzo has the potential to deal a lot of damage, but he can feel really inconsistent, even at a medium distance. By increasing the projectile speed, we’re extending his reliable range, making it easier to land shots without having to perfectly predict enemy movement. To compensate for the increased projectile speed, we’ve decreased the size of his arrows, meaning his shots now require a bit more accuracy.  
-Mei
--Blizzard
---Projectile now pierces barriers
---Radius has been increased from 8 meters to 10 meters
-Developer Comments: Mei has an interesting toolkit, but her ultimate often felt like it was too difficult to use effectively. Consequently, it felt weak compared to many other ultimate abilities. The freeze effect has been piercing barriers for some time now, but the projectile would still be blocked. Now, you can throw it down exactly where you want it, so it’s much easier to utilize the full radius effectively.
-McCree
--Deadeye
---Now drains over a .25-second period (instead of displaying a 50% reduction on the ultimate meter when activated and 0% when confirmed)
-Developer Comments: If players managed to counter or avoid McCree's ultimate, it would often regenerate very quickly since only half of the ultimate charge was spent. Now, this ultimate works like every other ultimate that has a duration.
-Mercy
--Caduceus Staff
---Healing Beam
---Healing-per-second has been increased by 20%
--Resurrect
---Resurrected allies will be able to maneuver after 2.25 seconds (reduced from 3 seconds)
-Developer Comments: Resurrection now allows teammates to jump back into the fight more quickly, which should help Mercy survive after activating her ultimate. Mercy's healing is also getting a boost to solidify her role as a strong, single-target healer.
-Genji
--Double jump no longer resets when wall climbing
--Swift Strike
---No longer deals damage to traps like Widowmaker's Venom Mine or Junkrat's Steel Trap
---No longer bypasses Junkrat's Steel Trap
---No longer interrupts quick melee attacks
--Dragonblade
---Duration of Genji's ultimate has been reduced from 8 seconds to 6 seconds
-Developer Comments: Genji was a little too difficult to pin down, and these changes will balance his speed. Swift Strike no longer cancels the recovery time from a quick melee attack, so players will no longer be able to get a free melee attack before using Swift Strike. Lastly, Dragonblade's duration was long enough that it often felt too difficult to reasonably counter.
-Lúcio
--Amp It Up
---The boosting of movement speed has been decreased by 30% (from a 100% increase to a 70% increase)
-Developer Comments: Thanks to Lúcio's speed increase, he was almost a must pick in every lineup.
-Roadhog
--Chain Hook
---If the hooked target isn't in Roadhog's line of sight when retracting the hook, they will be moved back to the position where they were originally hooked
-Developer Comments: This change means that hooked targets will be less likely to slide along walls, potentially ending up in an odd place after they've been reeled in.
-Soldier: 76
--Heavy Pulse Rifle
---Bullet spread now happens more quickly when unloading fully-automatic pulse fire
---Significantly Increased bullet spread recovery time
-Developer Comments: These changes will make burst-firing feel more reliable and increase his effectiveness at longer ranges.
-Zenyatta
--Orb of Discord
---The amount of damage amplified by a target with Orb of Discord has been decreased from 50% to 30%
--Orb of Destruction
---Damage has been increased from 40 to 46
-Developer Comments: Zenyatta is in a far better place since the last update, but the strength of Orb of Discord has turned him into an almost mandatory pick. These changes reduce Orb of Discord's effectiveness, but his damage-dealing potential has been increased. The amount of damage that he delivers should feel largely unaffected by the change.

HERO BALANCE UPDATES
-Ana
--Biotic Rifle
---Rate of fire increased by 20%
---Magazine size increased from 8 to 10
-Developer Comments: While Ana has been very well received, she was showing to be a little bit weaker overall. In addition to helping her feel better to play, these changes should also increase her healing and damage output.
-McCree
--Peacemaker
---Primary Fire
----Damage falloff range decreased by 10 meters
-----Damage falloff amount is unchanged
-----As a result, even with this change, McCree’s effective range is still higher than it was at launch
---Alternate Fire
----Rate of fire increased by 15%
---Flashbang
----Recovery time (i.e. the amount of time before McCree can fire again) decreased from 0.5 seconds to 0.35 seconds
-Developer Comments: McCree’s latest range increase helped him quite a bit, but it was a bit too much in the right hands. This change weakens his long range damage somewhat, but still keeps it stronger than it has been in the recent past. The other changes combine to allow him to land more alternate fire shots on targets that he has hit with Flashbang.
BUG FIXES
-Heroes
--Targets of Ana’s Sleep Dart will no longer instantly recover when damaged (recovery time is now 0.5 seconds)
-User Interface
--Fixed UI compatibility issues for ATI cards
--Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause Lúcio, Mei, and other models to only partially render (or disappear)

PATCH FEATURES
-New Hero: Ana (Support)
After being out of the fight for several years, one of Overwatch's founding members is returning. Introducing Ana—a battle-scarred veteran who supports her teammates from a distance using a unique and highly specialized collection of weapons.
-Ana’s primary weapon is her Biotic Rifle, which fires long-range darts that can restore the health of her allies or deal ongoing damage to her enemies. Meanwhile, her Biotic Grenade is perfect for a close-quarters clash, simultaneously healing teammates and injuring foes caught in its small area of effect. (Affected allies will also receive a temporary increase to all incoming healing, while affected enemies can’t be healed for a few moments.) And if the battle starts to get out of hand, Ana's sidearm can fire a Sleep Dart, knocking her adversaries unconscious.
-Plus, Ana's ultimate ability, Nano Boost, empowers one of her teammates, granting faster movement, increased damage, and resistance to enemy attacks.
-To learn more about Ana, click here.
GENERAL UPDATES
-Gameplay
--If a match goes into Overtime for more than 20 seconds, the fuse will now start to "burn down" more quickly
--Players now respawn more slowly during Overtime (increased spawn time by 2 seconds)
-Competitive Play
--Competitive Play matches can now only have one of each hero per team.
---For more info, click here.
-Miscellaneous
--Added Ana as an AI-controlled hero in Practice vs. AI, Play vs. AI, and Custom Game modes
--Timing on Zenyatta's Rapid Discord achievement is more lenient
--Targeted teammates now respond by saying "I'm with you," when players use the “Group Up” communication
--Renamed five sprays to avoid duplicate titles
HERO BALANCE UPDATES
-General
--Self-healing abilities now charge ultimate abilities. As a result, some heroes’ ultimate costs have been adjusted (see below).
-Bastion
--Configuration: Tank
---Ultimate cost increased by 10%
-D.Va
--Defense Matrix
---Cooldown decreased from 10 seconds to 1 second
---A new resource meter has been added. This meter will deplete while Defense Matrix is active and then recharge when it’s not in use.
----Defense Matrix takes 10 seconds to reach full charge from empty
----At a full charge, Defense Matrix will last for 4 seconds
----Defense Matrix will now remain active as long as its assigned hotkey is held
---Defense Matrix has been reclassified as an alternate fire and is now bound to RMB (by default)
----An option to "Toggle Defense Matrix" has been added under Options > Controls > D.Va
--Self-Destruct
---Ultimate cost decreased by 15%
---Explosion delay reduced from 4 seconds to 3 seconds
---Explosion no longer damages D.Va (the player who activates it)
-Developer Notes: D.Va isn't being selected as often as our other tanks, and we feel a lot of that stems from the underperformance of her damage absorption abilities. So, we've reconfigured her Defensive Matrix, making it more flexible and giving players the ability to use it more often. We’ve also given Self-Destruct a little more oomph, because it felt slightly underwhelming when compared to many of Overwatch's other ultimate abilities.
-
-Lúcio
--Sound Barrier
---Ultimate cost increased by 10%
-McCree
--Peacekeeper
---Now maintains full damage at longer distances, but will deal less damage at extreme ranges
-Developer Notes: While the game does feel better following the nerf to McCree’s close-range damage in a previous patch, it left him a little too weak. So, we're increasing his effective distance, making his range similar to Soldier: 76’s. This should hopefully give players another option for dealing with pesky long-range damage dealing heroes like Pharah and Hanzo. 
-
-Mercy
--Caduceus Staff
---Damage Boost
----Effect will no longer stack with bonus damage provided by another Mercy
--Resurrect
---Ultimate charge cost increased by 30%
---Movement is no longer prevented during activation
---Guardian Angel instantly resets upon use
-Developer Notes: Mercy's ultimate is one of the most powerful abilities in the game; however, players would often fly into the fray and die while using it. With this update, Resurrect will now take a bit longer to charge, but Mercy will be a lot safer when activating the ability in the middle of combat. 
-
-Roadhog
--Whole Hog
---Ultimate cost increased by 45%
-Soldier: 76
--Heavy Pulse Rifle
---Spread recovery will begin after a short delay (rather than instantly)
--Tactical Visor
---Ultimate cost increased by 10%
-Zenyatta
--Base shields increased by 50 (now 50 Health/150 Shield)
--Primary fire weapon damage decreased from 45 to 40
--Alternate fire weapon damage increased from 35 to 40
--Orb of Discord and Orb of Harmony
---Projectile speed has been increased from 30 to 120
--Transcendence
---Movement speed is now doubled upon activation
---Healing amount increased from 200 to 300 health per second
-Developer Notes: While Zenyatta has never had the healing abilities of Lúcio or Mercy, he made up for it by dealing more damage. However, his lack of mobility and low health has meant he’s struggled to find a place in many games. To increase his effectiveness, we've made several changes, the biggest of which is an increased shield pool. This will allow him to go head-to-head with more enemies. The Orb of Harmony and Discord changes are also a quality of life change, helping Zenyatta move his orbs around and apply their effects more quickly. And lastly, we’ve increased Transcendence’s healing throughput. This ultimate was designed to be the most effective against sustained, high-damage fire and least effective against short, high-damage bursts (like D.Va’s or Junkrat's ultimates). But, due to the amount of healing it provided, there were times when it was possible for even sustained fire to overcome Transcendence’s output. We’ve made the heal powerful and also allowed Zenyatta to move around more quickly while it’s active. 
USER INTERFACE UPDATES
-Game Options
--Players can now enter numerical values for any option that also has slider (e.g. FoV, volume, sensitivity, etc.)

--Fixed a bug where Mei’s Ice Wall would persist in the game world even after the player switched heroes or left the game
--Fixed even more bugs that allowed Reaper to Shadow Step to unintended locations
--Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Reinhardt’s Barrier Field to get stuck in the “on” position if the player used the “Toggle Barrier” setting
--Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Roadhog to accidentally Chain Hook targets standing behind him

---Note: You must be present for the conclusion of the match to be eligible for the win. If you leave a match and do not rejoin again before it’s over, it will count as a loss both in your placement match history and when calculating your Skill Rating adjustment.
--Fixed an issue where you would still receive a Competitive Play “leave” penalty even if you rejoined a match and completed it
---Note: If you leave a single Competitive Play match more than 3 times, you will receive a Competitive Play “leave” penalty even if you complete the match.

PATCH FEATURES
-New Feature: Competitive Play
Overwatch is raising the bar for competitive players, giving them the perfect arena to sharpen their skills and hone their strategies. Introducing Competitive Play.
-Competitive Play is designed for players who truly want to put their skills to the test, and offers a more serious experience than our Quick Play or Weekly Brawl! modes. To make sure everyone playing the mode has a solid understanding of the game’s mechanics, maps, and heroes, Competitive Play will be locked until you hit level 25.
-Once you reach level 25, the mode will become available under the "Play" button in the main menu. Simply select "Competitive Play" from the submenu, and you're ready to enter a match. You can join on your own or in a group, and Overwatch’s matchmaking system will automatically find the best game possible for your (or your group's) skill level.
-Competitive Play is live right now! To learn more about this new feature, click here.

GENERAL
--Disabled "Avoid This Player" functionality
---Note: The game UI option is still active, but will be removed in a future patch
-Developer comments: The "Prefer"/"Avoid" player system was designed with the best intentions; however, it's not currently performing in a way that we feel is healthy for the game. While the "Prefer This Player" option is more or less working as intended (and is thus still enabled), the "Avoid This Player" option has impacted the matchmaker in negative way and led to some very poor player experiences. Although we like the idea of being able to say "hey, I'd prefer not to play with this player," the implementation of the mechanic is not where it needs to be, so we've disabled it and will be removing the UI option in a future patch. 
BUG FIXES
--Fixed even more bugs that allowed Reaper to Shadow Step to unintended locations on certain maps
--Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause projectiles to hit Reinhardt instead of his Barrier Field in "High Bandwidth" Custom Games
